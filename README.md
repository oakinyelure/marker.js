### 1. Introduction

In  the beginning, this.was a fulfilment of a requirement at work. I also was was really hyped about the new ES6 release of the class and static keyword. As at the time of writing this library, I am still a student of IUPUI and a Java and PHP developer so please review my code with extreme criticism.

this.dream is to create a complete mapping package that solves a wide array of mapping problems. Like Jquery, *Do more with less*, I intend to be able to do a lot of things with the google map with just a method call.

this.structure is a simple OOP modelled after Java except that this is javascript. If you need to help out, class documentation is at [Developer.Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes). There is a lot in there. 

The Difference

Normal functional object would do this

function example(foo,bar) {

this.foo = foo;
this.bar = bar;

var doSomeThing() {

//do something
}
}

Now I have this

class example {

constructor(foo,bar) {

this.foo = foo;
this.bar = bar;

}

doSomething() {

// do something
}
}


No Big difference I know.
